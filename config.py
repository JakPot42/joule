"""config.py — every number here cites a specific real, public document.
No logic lives here. See README "Data sourcing" for the full citation
list and the one real research finding that shaped this design: DoD's
CURRENT-format public energy reporting (the Annual Energy Performance,
Resilience, and Readiness Report, FY2018+) publishes only DoD-wide and
service-level aggregates -- no per-installation breakdown. The last
public per-installation breakdown found was the FY2014 Annual Energy
Management Report, Appendix E. That is the most recent real, citable,
per-installation figure available, and is used here, dated and disclosed
as such rather than silently treated as current.
