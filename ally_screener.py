"""ally_screener.py — Allied Nation Energy Vulnerability Screener.

Deterministic scoring from two live World Bank indicators (worldbank.py):
  - Energy import dependency (0-70 pts): net energy imports as % of energy
    use, clamped to [0,100] (net exporters score 0 here -- they aren't
    import-vulnerable by this measure).
  - Renewable energy share (0-30 pts, inverse): lower domestic renewable
    share scores higher here, as a disclosed proxy for diversification
    away from imports -- NOT a claim that renewables are the only
    domestic energy resource a country might have (nuclear, coal, gas
    production also reduce import dependency and are already captured
    directly by the import-dependency indicator itself).
Weights (70/30) are disclosed, not derived from a published DoD formula --
no such public formula was found in this build's research; see README.
