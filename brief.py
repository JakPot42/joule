"""brief.py — Claude synthesis for the SMR siting brief and the allied
energy vulnerability brief. Same doctrine as every Claude call site in
this portfolio: every number is computed deterministically upstream
(smr_screener.py / ally_screener.py) -- Claude only narrates already-
computed numbers into plain English, never invents or adjusts one.
DEMO_MODE (default) uses a deterministic template, no API key needed.
