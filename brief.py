"""brief.py — Claude synthesis for the SMR siting brief and the allied
energy vulnerability brief. Same doctrine as every Claude call site in
this portfolio: every number is computed deterministically upstream
(smr_screener.py / ally_screener.py) -- Claude only narrates already-
computed numbers into plain English, never invents or adjusts one.
DEMO_MODE (default) uses a deterministic template, no API key needed.

Live-mode Claude call delegates to the shared claude_brief.call_claude()
(Phase 6, Cluster 5 consistency pass) with on_error="fallback" -- matches
this repo's own prior behavior (a screening command's score/tier is the
substance; the brief is prose on top, so a Claude failure falls back to
the already-computed deterministic template rather than crashing).
